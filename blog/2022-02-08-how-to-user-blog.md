> _This article mainly guides you how to publish blog posts on the Linkis official website. You are welcome to submit blog post documents about Apache Linkis, including but not limited to Linkis installation/source code analysis/architecture/experience sharing._

This article mainly refers to Docusaurus' official [blog post specifications and examples] (<https://docusaurus.io/zh-CN/blog>). The guidelines and specifications may not be perfect. Any comments or suggestions are welcome.

<!--truncate-->
## Resource path

- Chinese blog post warehouse path: <https://github.com/apache/incubator-linkis-website/tree/dev/i18n/zh-CN/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog>
- English blog post warehouse path: <https://github.com/apache/incubator-linkis-website/tree/dev/blog>

Each blog post needs to support both Chinese and English. Please do not omit the corresponding English documents when submitting.

## File naming

The framework will automatically parse the release date in YYYY-MM-DD format from the directory/file name

- eg: blog/2021-02-08-how-to-user-blog.md
- The access path of http is: <http://xxxxx/blog/2021/02/08/how-to-user-blog>

The blog post release log will automatically parse the corresponding date according to the file: 2021-02-08, so the default is to sort by date.

## Graphic blog specification

- ⚠ If the blog post involves image resources and needs to load local image resources, please use the form of a folder, so that the resources such as images required by the blog can be conveniently put together with the Markdown document.
- ⚠ If it is a picture of the architecture/process, the original project file, such as .vsdx file, please upload it to the img directory for subsequent modification. Please ensure that no Chinese pictures appear in English blog posts.

```shell script
|-- blog
| |--2021-02-08-how-to-user-blog
| | |-- img //Store the image
| | |-- index.md //Blog content
````

Reference example:

- Source: <https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/website/blog/2022-01-24-docusaurus-2021-recap>
- Visual Effects: <https://docusaurus.io/zh-CN/blog/2022/01/24/docusaurus-2021-recap>

## Summary

The blog's home page ( /blog by default) is the blog list page, which displays all blog posts.

Use <!--truncate--> in blog posts to mark article abstracts. <!--truncate--> The above content will become a summary and will be displayed on the blog homepage.
for example:

````markdown
---
title: Abstract example
---

All these will be part of the blog post summary.

Even include this line.

<!--truncate-->

But this line and the content below this line will not be truncated.

This line will not.

Neither will this line.
````

## Metadata information

Markdown documents can use the following Markdown frontend metadata fields, enclosed by lines on either side of ---.
