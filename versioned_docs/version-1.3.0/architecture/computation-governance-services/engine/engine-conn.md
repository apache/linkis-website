EngineConn architecture design
==================

EngineConn: Engine connector, a module that provides functions such as unified configuration management, context service, physical library, data source management, microservice management, and historical task query for other microservice modules.

Introduction to the second-level module:
==============

linkis-computation-engineconn interactive engine connector
---------------------------------------------

The ability to provide interactive computing tasks.

| Core class               | Core function                                                   |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| EngineConnTask       | Defines the interactive computing tasks submitted to EngineConn                     |
| ComputationExecutor  | Defined interactive Executor, with interactive capabilities such as status query and task kill. |
| TaskExecutionService | Provides management functions for interactive computing tasks                             |

linkis-engineconn-common engine connector common module
--------------------------------------------

Define the most basic entity classes and interfaces in the engine connector. EngineConn is used to create a connection session for the underlying computing storage engine, which contains the session information between the engine and the specific cluster, and is the client that communicates with the specific engine.

| Core Service           | Core function                                                             |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EngineCreationContext | Contains the context information of EngineConn during startup                               |
| EngineConn            | Contains the specific information of EngineConn, such as type, specific connection information with layer computing storage engine, etc. |
| EngineExecution       | Provide Executor creation logic                                               |
| EngineConnHook        | Define the operations before and after each phase of engine startup                                       |

The core logic of linkis-engineconn-core engine connector
------------------------------------------

Defines the interfaces involved in the core logic of EngineConn.

| Core class            | Core function                           |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| EngineConnManager | Provide related interfaces for creating and obtaining EngineConn |
| ExecutorManager   | Provide related interfaces for creating and obtaining Executor   |
| ShutdownHook      | Define the operation of the engine shutdown phase             |

linkis-engineconn-launch engine connector startup module
------------------------------------------

Defines the logic of how to start EngineConn.

| Core class           | core function                 |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| EngineConnServer | EngineConn microservice startup class |

The core logic of the linkis-executor-core executor
------------------------------------

>   Defines the core classes related to the actuator. The executor is a real computing scene executor, responsible for submitting user code to EngineConn.

| Core class                 | Core function                                                   |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Executor | It is the actual computational logic execution unit and provides a top-level abstraction of the various capabilities of the engine. |
| EngineConnAsyncEvent | Defines EngineConn-related asynchronous events |
| EngineConnSyncEvent | Defines EngineConn-related synchronization events |
| EngineConnAsyncListener | Defines EngineConn related asynchronous event listener |
| EngineConnSyncListener | Defines EngineConn related synchronization event listener |
| EngineConnAsyncListenerBus | Defines the listener bus for EngineConn asynchronous events |
| EngineConnSyncListenerBus | Defines the listener bus for EngineConn synchronization events |
| ExecutorListenerBusContext | Defines the context of the EngineConn event listener |
| LabelService | Provide label reporting function |
| ManagerService | Provides the function of information transfer with LinkisManager |

linkis-callback-service callback logic
-------------------------------

| Core Class         | Core Function |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| EngineConnCallback | Define EngineConn's callback logic |

linkis-accessible-executor can be accessed executor
--------------------------------------------

Executor that can be accessed. You can interact with it through RPC requests to get its status, load, concurrency and other basic indicators Metrics data.


| Core Class               | Core Function                                   |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|

| AccessibleExecutor | The Executor that can be accessed can interact with it through RPC requests. |
| NodeHealthyInfoManager | Manage Executor's Health Information |
| NodeHeartbeatMsgManager | Manage the heartbeat information of Executor |
| NodeOverLoadInfoManager | Manage Executor load information |
| Listener | Provides events related to Executor and the corresponding listener definition |
| EngineConnTimedLock | Define Executor level lock |
