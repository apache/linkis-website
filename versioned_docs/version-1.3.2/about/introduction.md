 Linkis builds a layer of computation middleware between upper applications and underlying engines. By using standard interfaces such as REST/WS/JDBC provided by Linkis, the upper applications can easily access the underlying engines such as MySQL/Spark/Hive/Presto/Flink, etc., and achieve the intercommunication of user resources like unified variables, scripts, UDFs, functions and resource files，and provides data source and metadata management services through REST standard interface. at the same time.

As a computation middleware, Linkis provides powerful connectivity, reuse, orchestration, expansion, and governance capabilities. By decoupling the application layer and the engine layer, it simplifies the complex network call relationship, and thus reduces the overall complexity and saves the development and maintenance costs as well.

Since the first release of Linkis in 2019, it has accumulated more than **700** trial companies and **1000+** sandbox trial users, which involving diverse industries, from finance, banking, tele-communication, to manufactory, internet companies and so on. Lots of companies have already used Linkis as a unified entrance for the underlying computation and storage engines of the big data platform.

## Features

- **Support for diverse underlying computation storage engines** : Spark, Hive, Python, Shell, Flink, JDBC, Pipeline, Sqoop, OpenLooKeng, Presto, ElasticSearch, Trino, SeaTunnel, etc.;

- **Support for diverse language** : SparkSQL, HiveSQL, Python, Shell, Pyspark, Scala, JSON and Java;

- **Powerful computing governance capability** : It can provide task routing, load balancing, multi-tenant, traffic control, resource control and other capabilities based on multi-level labels;

- **Support full stack computation/storage engine** : The ability to receive, execute and manage tasks and requests for various compute and storage engines, including offline batch tasks, interactive query tasks, real-time streaming tasks and data lake tasks;

- **Unified context service** : supports cross-user, system and computing engine to associate and manage user and system resource files (JAR, ZIP, Properties, etc.), result sets, parameter variables, functions, UDFs, etc., one setting, automatic reference everywhere;

- **Unified materials** : provides system and user level material management, can share and flow, share materials across users, across systems;

- **Unified data source management** : provides the ability to add, delete, check and change information of Hive, ElasticSearch, Mysql, Kafka, MongoDB and other data sources, version control, connection test, and query metadata information of corresponding data sources;

- **Error code capability** : provides error codes and solutions for common errors of tasks, which is convenient for users to locate problems by themselves;

## Documentation

The documentation of linkis is in [Linkis-WebSite](https://github.com/apache/linkis-website)

## Architecture
Linkis services could be divided into three categories: computation governance services, public enhancement services and microservice governance services.  
- The computation governance services, support the 3 major stages of processing a task/request: submission -> preparation -> execution.
- The public enhancement services, including the material library service, context service, and data source service.
- The microservice governance services, including Spring Cloud Gateway, Eureka and Open Feign.

Below is the Linkis architecture diagram. You can find more detailed architecture docs in [Architecture](../architecture/overview.md).
