## Notes

If you are new to Linkis, you can ignore this chapter, however, if you are already a Linkis user,  we recommend you reading the following article before installing or upgrading: [Brief introduction of the difference between Linkis1.0 and Linkis0.X](https://github.com/WeBankFinTech/Linkis-Doc/blob/master/en_US/Architecture_Documents/DifferenceBetween1.0%260.x.md).

Please note: Apart from the four EngineConnPlugins included in the Linkis1.0 installation package by default: Python/Shell/Hive/Spark. You can manually install other types of engines such as JDBC depending on your own needs. For details, please refer to EngineConnPlugin installation documents.

Engines that Linkis1.0 has adapted by default are listed below:

| Engine Type   | Adaptation Situation   | Included in official installation package |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Python        | Adapted in 1.0         | Included                                  |

## 1. Determine your installation environment 

The following is the dependency information for each engine.

| Engine Type | Dependency                  | Special Instructions                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Python      | Python Environment          | If the path of logs and result sets are configured as hdfs://, then the HDFS environment is needed. |
| JDBC        | No dependency               | If the path of logs and result sets are configured as hdfs://, then the HDFS environment is needed. |
| Shell       | No dependency               | If the path of logs and result sets are configured as hdfs://, then the HDFS environment is needed. |
| Hive        | Hadoop and Hive Environment |                                                              |
| Spark       | Hadoop/Hive/Spark           |                                                              |
                                                         
**Requirement: At least 3G memory is required to install Linkis. **
                                                         
The default JVM heap memory of each microservice is 512M, and the heap memory of each microservice can be adjusted uniformly by modifying `SERVER_HEAP_SIZE`.If your computer resources are small, we suggest to modify this parameter to 128M. as follows:

```bash
    vim ${LINKIS_HOME}/config/linkis-env.sh
```

```bash
    # java application default jvm memory.
    export SERVER_HEAP_SIZE="128M"
```

## 2. Linkis environment preparation

### a. Fundamental software installation

The following softwares must be installed:

- MySQL (5.5+), How to install MySQL
- JDK (1.8.0_141 or higher) How to install JDK

### b. Create user

For example: **The deploy user is hadoop**.

1. Create a deploy user on the machine for installation.

```bash
    sudo useradd hadoop  
```

2. Since the services of Linkis use  sudo -u {linux-user} to switch engines to execute jobs, the deploy user should have sudo permission and do not need to enter the password.

```bash
    vi /etc/sudoers
```

```text
    hadoop  ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: NOPASSWD: ALL
```

3. **Set the following global environment variables on each installation node so that Linkis can use Hadoop, Hive and Spark.**

   Modify the .bash_rc of the deploy user, the command is as follows:

```bash     
    vim /home/hadoop/.bash_rc ##Take the deploy user hadoop as an example.
```

​		The following is an example of setting environment variables:

```bash
    #JDK
    export JAVA_HOME=/nemo/jdk1.8.0_141

    ##If you do not use Hive, Spark or other engines and do not rely on Hadoop as 			well,then there is no need to modify the following environment variables.
    #HADOOP  
    export HADOOP_HOME=/appcom/Install/hadoop
    export HADOOP_CONF_DIR=/appcom/config/hadoop-config
    #Hive
    export HIVE_HOME=/appcom/Install/hive
    export HIVE_CONF_DIR=/appcom/config/hive-config
    #Spark
    export SPARK_HOME=/appcom/Install/spark
    export SPARK_CONF_DIR=/appcom/config/spark-config/spark-submit
    export PYSPARK_ALLOW_INSECURE_GATEWAY=1  # Parameters must be added to Pyspark
```

4. **If you want to equip your Pyspark and Python with drawing functions, you need to install the drawing module on each installation node**. The command is as follows:

```bash
    python -m pip install matplotlib
```

### c. Preparing installation package

Download the latest installation package from the Linkis release. ([Click here to enter the download page](https://github.com/WeBankFinTech/Linkis/releases))

Decompress the installation package to the installation directory and modify the configuration of the decompressed file.

```bash   
    tar -xvf  wedatasphere-linkis-x.x.x-combined-package-dist.tar.gz
```

### d. Basic configuration modification(Do not rely on HDFS)

```bash
    vi config/linkis-env.sh
```

```properties

    #SSH_PORT=22        #Specify SSH port. No need to configuer if the stand-alone version is installed
    deployUser=hadoop      #Specify deploy user
    LINKIS_INSTALL_HOME=/appcom/Install/Linkis    # Specify installation directory.
    WORKSPACE_USER_ROOT_PATH=file:///tmp/hadoop    # Specify user root directory. Generally used to store user's script and log files, it's user's workspace. 
    RESULT_SET_ROOT_PATH=file:///tmp/linkis   # The result set file path, used to store the result set files of the Job.
	ENGINECONN_ROOT_PATH=/appcom/tmp #Store the installation path of ECP. A local directory where deploy user has write permission.
    ENTRANCE_CONFIG_LOG_PATH=file:///tmp/linkis/  #Entrance's log path

    ## LDAP configuration. Linkis only supports deploy user login by default, you need to configure the following parameters to support multi-user login.
    #LDAP_URL=ldap://localhost:1389/ 
    #LDAP_BASEDN=dc=webank,dc=com
```

### e. Basic configuration modification(Rely on HDFS/Hive/Spark)

```bash
     vi config/linkis-env.sh
```

```properties
    SSH_PORT=22       #Specify SSH port. No need to configuer if the stand-alone version is installed
    deployUser=hadoop      #Specify deploy user
    WORKSPACE_USER_ROOT_PATH=file:///tmp/hadoop     #Specify user root directory. Generally used to store user's script and log files, it's user's workspace.
    RESULT_SET_ROOT_PATH=hdfs:///tmp/linkis   # The result set file path, used to store the result set files of the Job.
	ENGINECONN_ROOT_PATH=/appcom/tmp #Store the installation path of ECP. A local directory where deploy user has write permission.
    ENTRANCE_CONFIG_LOG_PATH=hdfs:///tmp/linkis/  #Entrance's log path

    #1.0 supports multi-Yarn clusters, therefore, YARN_RESTFUL_URL must be configured
 	YARN_RESTFUL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8088  #URL of Yarn's ResourceManager

    # If you want to use it with Scriptis, for CDH version of hive, you need to set the following parameters.(For the community version of Hive, you can leave out the following configuration.)
    HIVE_META_URL=jdbc://...   #URL of Hive metadata database
    HIVE_META_USER=   # username of the Hive metadata database 
    HIVE_META_PASSWORD=    # password of the Hive metadata database
    
    # set the conf directory of hadoop/hive/spark
    HADOOP_CONF_DIR=/appcom/config/hadoop-config  #hadoop's conf directory
    HIVE_CONF_DIR=/appcom/config/hive-config   #hive's conf directory
    SPARK_CONF_DIR=/appcom/config/spark-config #spark's conf directory

    ## LDAP configuration. Linkis only supports deploy user login by default, you need to configure the following parameters to support multi-user login.
    #LDAP_URL=ldap://localhost:1389/ 
    #LDAP_BASEDN=dc=webank,dc=com
    
    ##If your spark version is not 2.4.3, you need to modify the following parameter：
    #SPARK_VERSION=3.1.1

    ##：If your hive version is not 1.2.1, you need to modify the following parameter：
    #HIVE_VERSION=2.3.3
```

### f. Modify the database configuration

```bash   
    vi config/db.sh 
```

```properties    

    # set the connection information of the database
    # including ip address, database's name, username and port
    # Mainly used to store user's customized variables, configuration parameters, UDFs, and samll functions, and to provide underlying storage of the JobHistory.
    MYSQL_HOST=
    MYSQL_PORT=
    MYSQL_DB=
    MYSQL_USER=
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=
```

## 3. Installation and Startup

### 1. Execute the installation script:

```bash
    sh bin/install.sh
```

### 2. Installation steps

- The install.sh script will ask you whether to initialize the database and import the metadata. 

It is possible that a user might repeatedly run the install.sh script and results in clearing all data in databases. Therefore, each time the install.sh is executed, user will be asked if they need to initialize the database and import the metadata.

Please select yes on the **first installation**.

**Please note: If you are upgrading the existing environment of Linkis from 0.X to 1.0, please do not choose yes directly,  refer to Linkis1.0 Upgrade Guide first.**

### 3. Whether install successfully 

You can check whether the installation is successful or not by viewing the logs printed on the console. 

If there is an error message, check the specific reason for that error or refer to FAQ for help.

### 4. Linkis quick startup

(1). Start services

Run the following commands on the installation directory to start all services.

```bash  
  sh sbin/linkis-start-all.sh
```

(2). Check if start successfully 

You can check the startup status of the services on the Eureka, here is the way to check:

Open http://${EUREKA_INSTALL_IP}:${EUREKA_PORT} on the browser and check if services have registered successfully. 

If you have not specified EUREKA_INSTALL_IP and EUREKA_INSTALL_IP in config.sh, then the HTTP address is http://127.0.0.1:20303

As shown in the figure below, if all of the following micro-services are registered on theEureka, it means that they've started successfully and are able to work.
