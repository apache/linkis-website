## 1. Overview 
As a powerful computing middleware, Linkis can easily connect to different computing engines, by shielding the usage details of different computing engines, and providing upwards A unified set of use interfaces 
greatly reduces the operation and maintenance cost of deploying and applying Linkis' big data platform. At present, Linkis has connected with several mainstream computing engines, which basically cover the data requirements in production. 
In order to provide For better scalability, Linkis also provides relevant interfaces for accessing new engines, which can be used to access new computing engines. 
 
The engine is a component that provides users with data processing and analysis capabilities. At present, it has been connected to the Linkis engine. There are mainstream big data computing engines Spark, Hive, Presto, etc., as well as python, Shell, and other scripts capable of processing data. 
As a one-stop data operation platform connected with Linkis, DataSphere Studio can easily use the engine supported by Linkis in DataSphere Studio to complete interactive data analysis tasks and workflow tasks. 

The supported engines and versions are as follows:
