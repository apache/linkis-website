LinkisManager Architecture Design
====================
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an independent microservice of Linkis, LinkisManager provides AppManager (application management), ResourceManager (resource management), and LabelManager (label management) capabilities. It can support multi-active deployment and has the characteristics of high availability and easy expansion.  
## 1. Architecture Diagram

### Noun explanation
- EngineConnManager (ECM): Engine Manager, used to start and manage engines.
- EngineConn (EC): Engine connector, used to connect the underlying computing engine.
- ResourceManager (RM): Resource Manager, used to manage node resources.
## 2. Introduction to the second-level module
### 2.1. Application management module linkis-application-manager
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AppManager is used for unified scheduling and management of engines:  

| Core Interface/Class | Main Function |
|------------|--------|
|EMInfoService | Defines EngineConnManager information query and modification functions |
|EMRegisterService| Defines EngineConnManager registration function |
|EMEngineService | Defines EngineConnManager's creation, query, and closing functions of EngineConn |
|EngineAskEngineService | Defines the function of querying EngineConn |
