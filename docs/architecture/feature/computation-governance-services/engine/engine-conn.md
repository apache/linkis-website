## 1. Overview

    EngineConn: engine connector, which is used to connect to the underlying computing and storage engine to complete task execution, task information push and result return, etc. It is the basis for Linkis to provide computing and storage capabilities.

## 2. Overall Design

     The overall design idea of EngineConn is to complete the acquisition and storage of the session information of the underlying engine when starting, complete the connection between the EngineConn process and the underlying engine, and then complete the scheduling of tasks to the underlying engine Session stored in EngineConn through the Executor unit for execution. and get execution-related information.

### 2.1 Technical Architecture

**Introduction to related terms:**

**EngineConn:** Used to store the session information of the underlying engine. To complete the connection with the underlying engine, for example, the Spark engine stores the SparkSession.

**Executor:** The scheduling executor used to accept the task passed by the caller (such as: Entrance), and finally submit the task to the underlying engine Session for execution. Different tasks implement different Executor classes. The most used is the interactive ComputationExecutor, which is used to accept tasks and push task information to the caller in real time. And the non-interactive ManageableOnceExecutor that accepts only one task is used to complete the submission and execution of the task started by EngineConn.

## 3. Module design

Input: The caller executes the task

Output: return task information such as execution status, results, logs, etc.

Key logic: the timing diagram of the key logic of task execution

Key Notes:

1. If it is a serial Executor, after EngineConn receives a task, it will mark EngineConn as Busy and cannot accept other tasks, and will judge whether the lock of the task is consistent to prevent EngineConn from being submitted by multiple callers at the same time. After the task is executed, it becomes the Unlock state
2. If it is a parallel Executor, after EngineConn receives the task, the state is still in the Unlock state, and it can continue to accept the task. Only when the number of concurrent tasks is reached or the machine index is abnormal will it be marked as Busy state
3. If it is an Once type task, EngineConn will automatically execute the task after it is started, and the EngineConn process will exit after the task is executed.

## 6. Non-functional design

### 6.1 Security

1. All the relevant information of the task can only be queried by submitting the user
2. The default startup user of the EngineConn process is the submission user
### 6.2 Performance

EngineConn that supports concurrency supports colleagues to run a large number of tasks concurrently. For example, a single Trino EngineConn can run more than 300 trino tasks at the same time

### 6.3 Capacity

### 6.4 High Availability

EngineConn is a process started on demand and task. Support high availability

### 6.5 Data Quality
