2. The microservice governance services are Spring Cloud Gateway, Eureka and Open Feign already provided by Linkis 0.X, and Linkis 1.0 will also provide support for Nacos
3. Computing governance services are the core focus of Linkis 1.0, from submission, preparation to execution, overall three stages to comprehensively upgrade Linkis's ability to perform control over user tasks.
