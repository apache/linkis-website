Please note: Linkis provides a unified Storage module, so you must follow the Linkis path specification when using the path or configuring the path in the configuration file.



1. [**Compulsory**]When using a file path, whether it is local, HDFS, or HTTP, the schema information must be included. Among them:

    - The Scheme header for local file is: file:///;

    - The Scheme header for HDFS is: hdfs:///;

    - The Scheme header for HTTP is: http:///.



2. There should be no special characters in the path. Try to use the combination of English characters, underline and numbers.
